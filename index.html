            <h2>Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years:</h2>
            <p>Based on my background in Computer Science at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) and my experiences with projects like the Savannah GuestHouse Online Booking System and the Skillsync job portal, I've set some ambitious yet achievable tech goals for the next 2 years. These goals are designed to deepen my expertise, particularly in the areas of cybersecurity and emerging technologies, while also enhancing my professional development and network within the tech community.

                Master Cybersecurity Fundamentals: I plan to solidify my foundation in cybersecurity by pursuing certifications such as ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC). Additionally, I aim to stay abreast of the latest in cybersecurity through workshops and webinars, focusing on security protocols, threat analysis, and system security architecture.
                
                Develop Proficiency in Emerging Technologies: Emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, and blockchain have caught my interest. I intend to dive deep into these areas, working on projects that not only allow me to apply these technologies but also explore their potential in enhancing cybersecurity measures and creating efficient digital solutions.
                
                Contribute to Open Source Projects: Engaging with the open-source community is a priority. I plan to contribute to projects relevant to web development and cybersecurity, which will not only provide me with hands-on experience but also help me build a professional network.
                
                Publish Research or a Case Study: I aim to conduct a comprehensive study on a pressing issue within cybersecurity or digital transformation and publish my findings. This endeavor will help establish my thought leadership in the field.
                
                Gain Practical Experience through Internships: Securing internships or part-time roles in IT departments of leading organizations or tech startups is essential. I seek roles that offer hands-on experience with digital transformation initiatives and cybersecurity measures, furthering my practical skills.
                
                Enhance Soft Skills: Recognizing the importance of soft skills in the tech industry, I aim to improve my teamwork, leadership, and communication skills through workshops, online courses, and mentorship opportunities.
                
                Build a Personal Brand: I plan to create a professional portfolio website to showcase my projects, certifications, and contributions. Regularly updating a tech blog on this site will share my insights and experiences, further establishing my presence in the tech community.
                
                Network Actively: Attending tech conferences, seminars, and workshops will be crucial for networking with professionals in the field. Joining tech communities and forums online will keep me updated with industry trends and opportunities for collaboration.
                
                These goals are not just milestones I aim to achieve; they represent the path I'm taking to become a well-rounded professional ready to contribute significantly to the tech industry, particularly in cybersecurity and digital transformation.</p>
